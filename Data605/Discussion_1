## exercise C50
A three-digit number has two properties. The tens-digit and the ones-digit add up to 5. If the number is written with the digits in the reverse order, and then subtracted from the original number, the result is 792. Use a system of equations to find all of the three-digit numbers with these properties.

Solution :

The hundred's digit = x  
The tens digit = y  
The ones digit = z  

y + z = 5
y = 5- z (z is equal or less than 5)

100 * x + 10 * (5-z) + z - 100* z - 10* (5-z) - x = 792

99 * x - 99 * z = 792
 
x - z = 8

As x can be 8 and 9 only, z would be 0 and 1. 

Thus, the three-digit number is 850 or 941
